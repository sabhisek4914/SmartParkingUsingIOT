JSP
-----
servlets are very good at business logic not for presentation or business design. If we make any changes with servlet then we have to recompile and 
redeploy the entire web application, to avoid the drawback js[ was introduced.
It is no the replacement of servlet but it is the enhancement of servlet. Jsp is very good for business presentation if we make any changes to jsp 
then it is not required to recompile and redeploy the entire web application. jsp is internaly a servlet, jsp engine is responsible to convert jsp 
to servlet. If the jsp file name is index.jsp then servlet file name is index_jsp.java.
The technique to include java code in html known as jsp. The following are the advantages of the jsp over servlet:
-extension to servlet.
-easy to mainain.
-very fast deployment.
-no need to recompile and redeploy.


Stage to develop jsp:
1-create a file within web-content in the name of jsp.
-Run that file within web server.



Jsp lifecycle:
Like servlet jsp having a lifecycle.
-jsp translation
-compilation
-class loading
-instantiation
-initialization
-request processing
-memory deallocation
Jsp engine is only responsible to execute the 1st stage convert jsp code to servlet code and other stages are executed by servlet container.


Jsp 9 pre-defined objects and 5 pre-defined tags to develop jsp application:
objects:
out   -   JSPWriter
request  -HttpServletRequest
response -HttpServletResponse
session  -HttpSession
application - ServletContext
config      - ServletConfig
page        - Object
pageContext - PageContext
exception   - Throwable


out is used to write data into web browser.

request is an implicit object created for each jsp page by web container.

response- to hande the request response object is associated with each jsp page.

session- to manage the session jsp already provide the object of http session.

application- To set parameter globally we can use application object.

config- To set the parameter locally we can use the object of ServletConfig.

page- This always work as this keyword.

pageContext- to set the value in a given scope we can use pageContext attribute. It provides 4 scopes
:
-page_scope
-request_scope
-session_scope
-application_scope

exception - generally jsp is exception free but to the exception acording to requirement we can use exception object.

5 pre-defined tags:
scriptlet- It is used to place java code in html, the code written within scriptlet tag automatically placed into service method of the
 servlet the syntax of scriptlet is:-<%! 
                                       javacodes 
                                    %>

declaration- as jsp page automatically translated to servlet if we declare a variable within jsp it automatically place b/w the servletoutside
               service method. the syntax of declaretion <%-
                                                            Declaration 
                                                          %>

expression- This tag is self expressive to display or write text in web browser without any object we can use expression tag. There will be no
              semi-colon after statements.<%=
                                    javacodes
                                    %>

directive-
